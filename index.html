    <h4>
      fun fact cowboy boots <em>came from Northern Mexico</em> and thats why
      most cowboy boots are worn in the south
    </h4>
    <p>
      The first western boots were designed to be functional, cheap, and durable
      boots that cowboys could wear to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      the shoes and were <em>originally designed for work.</em> They also
      represented status and wealth and were worn by emperors and kings when
      much of the population went barefoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of cowboy boots took a turn the <em> 1930s and 40s,</em>when
      the influence of Hollywood and <em>growing popularity</em> of
      <em> Western films brought a whole new dimension</em> to the cowboy life
      in generalâ€”and to cowboy boots in particular.
